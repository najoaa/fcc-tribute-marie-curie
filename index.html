        Marie Curie (1867–1934) was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. 
        She discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, and developed techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes. 
        Her groundbreaking work earned her the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.

        Curie's achievements laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics and cancer treatment through radiation therapy. 
        She also founded the Radium Institute (now Curie Institute) in Paris, which remains a major center for medical research.
